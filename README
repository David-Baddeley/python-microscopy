**PYME-Exeter**

This is a fork of the python-microscopy project (by David Baddeley) that has in addition to David's original code a branch that has local changes from work in my lab at the University of Exeter.

There is not too much new or different material here, some differnt hardware backends and changes we required to make certain things work. I mainly maintain this repo to facilitate code exchange between David's and my copies of the repository. David's code gets on a semi-regular basis folded into this fork.

Info on PYME from David's ReadMe:

*The PYthon Microscopy Environment provides image acquisition and data analysis functionality for a number of widefield microscopy applications, but with a particular emphasis on single molecule localisation microscopy (PALM/STORM). The package is multi platform, running on Windows, Linux, and OSX.*
