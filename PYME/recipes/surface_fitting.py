class FitSurfaceWithPatches(ModuleBase):
    """
    Fits patches of quadratic planes to point data.

    Parameters
    ----------

    input : Input
        tabular data containing x, y, and z columns for the surface to be fit to.
    fit_influence_radius : Float
        The region around each localization to include in the surface fit [nm]. The fit is performed on all points
        falling within this radius of each control point.
    reconstruction_radius : Float
        The size of the reconstructed surface patch. This should usually be <= fit_influence_radius.
    constrain_surface_to_point : Bool
        Whether the fit should be constrained to pass through the control point.
    limit_reconstruction_to_support_hull: Bool
        If enabled, this will clip each surface reconstruction to the convex-hull of all the points used for the fit.
        Useful for avoiding the generation of large surface patches from isolated antibodies, but also reduces the
        ability to paper-over holes.
    alignment_threshold : Float
        Lower alignment_threshold keeps more patches, higher rejects more. For each patch, normal vectors for adjacent
        patches (within fit_influence_radius) are projected along the normal vector. If the median of these dot products
         is less than the alignment_threshold, the patch is removed.
    reconstruction_point_spacing : Float
        Spacing of points used to reconstruct the surface.

    Returns
    -------

    out_fits_raw : Output
        tabular data containing fit results for quadratic surface patches following the form
        $w(u,v) = A \times u^2 + B \times v^2$. See PYME.Analysis.points.surfit.fit_quad_surf.
    out_fits_filtered : Output
        Filtered version of out_fits_filtered. Use alignment_threshold to reject surface patches which differ greatly in
        orientation from their neighbors.
    out_surface_reconstruction : Output
        Reconstruction of out_fits_filtered. Fitted points are augmented with additional points to interpolate the
        surface. The density of this reconstruction can be altered using the reconstruction_point_spacing and
        reconstruction_radius parameters. Each point contains normal information and is compatible with shaded-point
        viewing.
