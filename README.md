PYME (the PYthon Microscopy Environment) is an open-source application suite for light microscopy image acquisition, data storage, visualization, and analysis. It offers a particularly comprehensive set of features for single molecule localisation based super-resolution techniques (PALM, STORM, PAINT, etc ...), but also has good support other microscopy modalities. The package is multi platform, running on Windows, Linux, and OSX.
